                                        As its first vision story implementation, Ruralnomics launched its first B2B and B2C product category by the name of #RunoFresh.
RunoFresh quickly acquired its brand presence in Guwahati, Dibrugarh, Pathshala and now in Shillong. The supply and delivery relationship is through a Technology Platform that enables Customers and Retailers to order online. This was launched to enable customers to order fresh and farm foods to their home with a click of button. This was  Ruralnomics first step to connect supplier, market and consumer through a seamless delivery model. The plan is to spread all corners of North East Indian Market in a Brick and Mortar Model
